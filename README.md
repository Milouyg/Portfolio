# portfolio-angular

## What to read here?
In this Readme you will read everything about me and how I made this portfolio step by step. 

## What programming languages have I used for this project?
For this project I have used Angular. The reason why I used Angular is because
I didn't wanted to make my portfolio the standard HTML, SCSS and Javascript.
Also I want to learn as much as possible and because we get React at school,
I thought it was nice to learn the basics of Angular by myself.
